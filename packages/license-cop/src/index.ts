// This is necessary because the @nx/dependency-checks eslint rule will
// remove commander if the license-cop package never imports from it directly.
//
// This approach was chosen over using the ignoredDependencies config option
// to insure that the same eslint rule continues to catch when the commander
// version falls out of sync with the @commander-js/extra-typings version.
